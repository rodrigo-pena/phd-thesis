# `data/`

## About

The files in this directory are Python `.pkl` objects gathering results from the experiments in `phd-thesis/python/`. The files are time-stamped with their creation date. 



## Reproduction

To recreate a similar dataset, simply open a terminal window, navigate to the `phd-thesis/python/` folder and type

```bash
sh run_all_experiments.sh
```

Be aware that this may take days or weeks to run, depending on the number of parallel CPU cores available.



## Thesis files

The sub-folder `data/curated/`Â contains the experiments that were selected for display in the figures of the thesis.
