# `data/`

The files in this directory are Python `.pkl` objects collecting results from the experiments in `phd-thesis/python/`. The files are time-stamped with their creation date. 


## Reproduction

To recreate a similar dataset, first navigate to the `phd-thesis/python/` folder and follow the installation instruction. Then, open a terminal window and type

```bash
sh run_all_experiments.sh
```
Be aware that this may take days or weeks to run, depending on the number of parallel CPU cores available.


## Thesis files

The sub-folder `data/curated/`Â contains the experiments that were selected for display in the figures of the thesis.
