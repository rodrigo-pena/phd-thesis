This repository contains all the code required to reproduce the contents of my PhD thesis, "On the optimal sampling design for the Graph Total Variation decoder: recovering piecewise-constant graph signals from a few vertex measurements", defended at [EPFL][epfl] on November 14 2019. You can find its PDF file [here][thesis-pdf].


## Repository structure

- `data/`
  - Contains all the experimental results, stored as Python `.pkl` files.
- `latex/`
  - Contains the $\LaTeX$ files used to compile the thesis in `.pdf` format.
- `python/`
  - Contains the Python routines for re-running the experiments and reproducing the figures in the thesis that are not directly generated by $\LaTeX$ commands.
